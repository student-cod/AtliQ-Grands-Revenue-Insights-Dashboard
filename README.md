# Hospitality Revenue Insights Dashboard (Power BI)

This project addresses a business challenge faced by AtliQ Grands, a hospitality chain experiencing a decline in market share and revenue. The objective was to provide data-driven insights to their revenue team to help them understand performance and regain market position, as they currently lack an internal data analytics team.

Using historical data provided for the challenge, a Power BI dashboard was developed to visualize key revenue and performance metrics.

## Dashboard Key Features & Insights:

Overall Revenue: Presents the total revenue generated (e.g., 1.71 Billion shown).
Occupancy Analysis: Visualizes occupancy percentage breakdown by hotel category (Business and Luxury).
Booking Platform Performance: Displays Realisation Percentage and Average Daily Rate (ADR) across different booking platforms.
Detailed Property Metrics: Provides a tabular view of key metrics for individual properties, including Revenue, RevPAR, Occupancy %, DSRN, DBRN, DURN, Realisation %, and Cancellation %.
Revenue Trends: Illustrates revenue trends over time, broken down by week number and category.
Interactive Filters: Includes slicers for filtering data by City, Room Type, and Week Number to enable dynamic analysis.

## Purpose:
To deliver a functional dashboard based on stakeholder requirements and mock-ups, providing clear visual insights into the hospitality business's revenue performance and contributing to data-driven decision-making.

## Tool Used:
